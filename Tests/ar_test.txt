The ar function works as the analogRead function does. It takes one argument which is the pin no between 0 and 5.
It returns an output between 0 for ground and 1023 for 5V.
A circuit was designed to test the workings of ar. An Arduino Uno was used to test the function
Circuit Description: A simple DC motor is attached to A0 and Ground and an LED is attached to Pin 3.
The circuit works in a simple way. The faster you rotate the motor in one direction the brighter the LED glows.
The python code for the above is provided as ar_test.py.
